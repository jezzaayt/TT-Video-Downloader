# TT Video Downloader

### Simple Tkinter to use Pyktok library to save TT videos. 

Pyktok is found [here](https://github.com/dfreelon/pyktok)

Made an UI to use Pyktok library if I ever wanted to do this incase of looking in the JSON of the URL. 

Currently the output is exactly where the folder is located. I may look at to see to change if can change the output location. 


This was just a fun unexpected project that I had a thought of in early hours of a morning and saw a library that allowed me to provide some output with UI elements. 

This is not at all affiliated with Tiktok or any libaries used in this project. 

## Buttons

#### Download Video

This will just download the requested URL to a mp4 file.

#### Download Video with Data

This will download the requested video file with csv output. If numerous are used it will all be stored in the same data.csv.  

(May in the future look to add option to change this file name.)
